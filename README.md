# Deploy your WebExtension to Firefox Addons

Based on [FirefoxAddonsBuilder](https://github.com/cardinalby/webext-buildtools-firefox-addons-builder) 
package. 

The action is intended to **update existing** published Addon and can't create a new one.

## API access

To setup API access you need to generate `jwtIssuer` and `jwtSecret`
([https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/)):

## Example

```yaml
uses: cardinalby/webext-buildtools-firefox-addons-action@v1
with:
  zipFilePath: 'build/extension.zip'
  extensionId: '{7b312f5e-9680-436b-acc1-9b09f60e8aaa}'
  jwtIssuer: ${{ secrets.FF_JWT_ISSUER }}
  jwtSecret: ${{ secrets.FF_JWT_SECRET }}
```

to pack your extension directory and provide this input from it's output.

### ðŸŸ§ `uploadId`
Id of already existing upload (can be obtained from outputs in case of error) to retry publishing.
Sometimes validating extension can take a long time, and you can repeat publishing with existing upload
id later (read [Implementing deferred steps](https://cardinalby.github.io/blog/post/github-actions/implementing-deferred-steps/)).

Either `zipFilePath` or `uploadId` inputs should be set.

### ðŸ”¸ `extensionId` _Required_

### ðŸ”¹ `sourcesZipFilePath`

You can use [webext-buildtools-pack-extension-dir-action](https://github.com/cardinalby/webext-buildtools-pack-extension-dir-action)
to pack your extension directory and provide this input from it's output.

### ðŸ”¹ `channel` _Optional, default: `listed`_
