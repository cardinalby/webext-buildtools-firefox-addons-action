# Deploy your WebExtension to Firefox Addons

Based on [FirefoxAddonsBuilder](https://github.com/cardinalby/webext-buildtools-firefox-addons-builder) 
package. 

The action is intended to **update existing** published Addon and can't create a new one.

## API access

To setup API access you need to generate `jwtIssuer` and `jwtSecret`
([https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/)):

## Example

```yaml
uses: cardinalby/webext-buildtools-firefox-addons-action@v1
with:
  zipFilePath: 'build/extension.zip'
  extensionId: '{7b312f5e-9680-436b-acc1-9b09f60e8aaa}'
  jwtIssuer: ${{ secrets.FF_JWT_ISSUER }}
  jwtSecret: ${{ secrets.FF_JWT_SECRET }}
```
